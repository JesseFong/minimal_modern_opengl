Minimal DSA/Bindless/Multidraw OpenGL

OpenGL is a Chonker of a spec at this point and while most people are moving to Vulkan and DX12,
I find that modern OpenGL is still usefull for personal projects because of its turseness and fire and forget approach to gpu memory
Finding reliable modern opengl resources can be difficult, so I wanted to make a sample app that brings a bit of it together.

Here are some useful resources I have used in the past
